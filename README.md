# service-worker-tutorial

This is a little tutorial to illustrate the usage of service workers

## What is included

### Registration of the service worker

See `main.js` unter `/js/main.js` for the registration of the service worker.

### Lifecycle events

The lifecycle events `install` and `activate` are implemented with some dummy code. Please change it to your needs.

### Functional events

Currently only the functional event `fetch` is implemented in order to see that caching is working.
